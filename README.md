Simulation presets of Ericksen-Leslie models with FEniCS

In general we consider two types of models. One is a rather simplified one (cf. ...) while the second one is of rather general nature (cf. ...). 

We offere several discretizations. Both models offer a rather narrow literature regarding practical algorithms in order to implement them. The main goal of this project is to make the implementation of new discretization techniques and experiments much more accessible (so far only for my own research). Note that the offered algorithms do not converge unconditionally, but their tuning is rather delicate.
Additionally in order to allow for studies of several discretization parameters and experiments, the current project allows running simulations in parallel by
